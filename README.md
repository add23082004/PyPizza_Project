As part of my current position at Python Pizza, my mission is to develop an automated pizza ordering program. This involves meticulously calculating the final bill based on the preferences specified by the user. The pricing structure is as follows:

Small Pizza: $15
Medium Pizza: $20
Large Pizza: $25

Additional charges apply for extra toppings:

Pepperoni for a Small Pizza: +$2
Pepperoni for a Medium or Large Pizza: +$3

Additionally, for customers desiring a richer cheese experience:

Extra cheese for any size of pizza: +$1
